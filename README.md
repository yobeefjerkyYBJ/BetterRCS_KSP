# BetterRCS_KSP
Better looking Waterfall FX for KSP's RCS thrusters.

I have WinterSabe to thank for walking me through setting up all of the cursed ModuleManager code to make this work.

**-=Changelog=-**

v0.1.1
-Added Hydrolox and Methalox plumes
-Updated ISP-based plumes to be more realistic and less goofy looking
-Specifically fixed BetterRCS_Base so the jelly effect isn't wildly expanded in vacuum

v0.1.0
-Added Regex based separation of RCS thruster types based on ISP
-Added 4 basic plumes for each thruster type


Known Issues:

Some thrusters are known to have incorrect plume placement, namely the Vernor Thruster.
