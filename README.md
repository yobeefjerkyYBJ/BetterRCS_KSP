# BetterRCS_KSP
Better looking Waterfall FX for KSP's RCS thrusters.

I have WinterSabe to thank for walking me through setting up all of the cursed ModuleManager code to make this work.

**-=Changelog=-**

v0.1.4 - 12/25/2025
-Updated BetterRCS_Base to look better.
-Refined support for InternalRCS.

v0.1.3 - 12/24/2025
-Fixes for Tundra's RCS thrusters plus a couple stock and one iRCS thruster.

v0.1.2 - 12/22/2025
-Hotfix, Hydrolox and Methalox RCSShocks were erroneously angled 90 degrees and also didn't respond to thrust inputs.

v0.1.1  - 12/22/2025
-Added Hydrolox and Methalox plumes
-Updated ISP-based plumes to be more realistic and less goofy looking
-Specifically fixed BetterRCS_Base so the jelly effect isn't wildly expanded in vacuum

v0.1.0 12/21/2025
-Added Regex based separation of RCS thruster types based on ISP
-Added 4 basic plumes for each thruster type


# Known Issues:

*In order for thrusters to be compatible, they must already have a waterfall configuration.*

Some thrusters are known to have incorrect plume placement, namely the stock Vernor Thruster.
